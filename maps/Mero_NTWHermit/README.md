Hello Gentlemen  

At a very big distance from the NTW castle lives the hermit  as a hermit he preffers to live alone away from other people. 

When finally someone come across his path he challenge him in various ways, that is why the map I am presenting now is 1v1  

The map is 220x80, for two players, advanced bases and the scavengers are included. 12 oils in base and another 18 around the map.

It has some features according to which according to me I subcalled it NTW. It is the typical frame, and rectangle or square base. I wanted it to be more interesting so I have put some cliffs, hills and enormous craters on it, and some lakes too  

Each base is divided partly in two equal halfs. And the bases are not so extremely defended this time but still appreciably.

It will be in two players section, as in NTW section we rather expect to have let me say typical  NTWs.

Bye  have fun
