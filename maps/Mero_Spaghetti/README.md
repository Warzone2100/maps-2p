Hello Gentlemen :)

After a very long pause I have finally created a map which was to warm me up, and I have noticed a lot of warming up I need.

it is called Spaghetti due to the fact that its shape a little bit reminds of its look :)

The map is for two players. Advanced bases and gateways are included. Ten oils per player. Scavengers.

Have fun :)
